	[Log 1]]:  I use to thoroughly enjoy life but now look at me, writing to myself to cope with living life. I remember the days as a kid where I would smile everyday and be excited about everything I came across. I used to love exploring the different areas around me. I wanted to change the world, make it a better place. But now look at me: 20 years old, living in a shitty apartment, having a dead end job, no friends, and my family disowned me. Life fucking sucks.

	[Log 2]]: Just sold my TV today to upgrade my PC and to buy a VR headset. I barely used the tv anyway. I know i won’t be able to buy as much food this month but who cares honestly, i’ll live. Hopefully these things will make my life more enjoyable.

	[Log 3]]: Work is really starting to really drain the life out of me. I’m working for a company that ultimately doesn’t give a shit about me and just uses my physical labour to make more profit. I feel like a slave honestly. And i have to work here unless i want to end up homeless on the street. I don’t have money for college and i don’t even make enough money to have a growing savings. I’m just stuck here. I’m basically just living to work but what else am i going to do? I don’t really have any motivations to achieve a goal or a drive to make a better life for myself. I guess you could say i’m fucking lazy or i’m one of those people that just became complacent with this sedimentary lifestyle. If i’m aware of this then, am i going against my purpose? But what is my purpose? Cause like i said it just seems like i don’t have one or that my purpose has left me, i missed it’s chance. I know that someday down the road i’ll probably lose my ability to critically think & reflect and will just live life on autopilot mode. Or i’ll just go insane, who knows. If i lived on autopilot mode would that mean i’m living without purpose? Would that mean i’m a walking dead body or a soulless slave/robot? Because the purpose i have right now, i didn’t choose but, the company i work for has placed a purpose on me. And that purpose is to make them enough money until i’m utterly useless and then eventually am just replaced. So my purpose is to work for an entity that doesn’t care about me and wants to use me. So that means i must be useless and am only useful as a cog in the machine. Once i can’t continue to operate, i’ll just be discarded. So my purpose in life must be to die. I’m working to die.

<pre2><center>[ ]]</center>	It’s odd how commonly a person questions their purpose. Modern society was designed to sell and strip a person of their purpose, their identity, at a rate faster than the mind has evolved to adjust. Only through a product with a meaning attached can we find meaning. Past societies have been so quick to assign a person a role in their life and this was something that gave them purpose, meaning to live, and now that meaning has been blurred far beyond recognition. Without a belief in some higher power what is there to give one meaning? Must one be delusional?</pre2>

	[Log 4]]: Right now the only thing in life i look forward to is coming home from work and being on the computer for hours on end. It’s honestly bringing me a type of joy i haven’t felt in a while. It could just be the dopamine going to my brain but who cares, i feel happy. I need to be careful though because i’ve been going to sleep later than usual and wake up feeling groggy due to sleep deprivation. I think it also might be due to not eating enough food this month. I can tell i’ve gotten a little skinnier, not like it really matters. I’ll have enough money next month to buy food. This PC upgrade and VR headset was totally worth it. I haven’t tried the VR headset yet, hopefully i’ll get to it sometime real soon. Just been surfing the web.

	[Log 5]]: Somehow i’ve made everything in my life turn into something depressing or a type of vice or just something straight destructive to me. The new addition is this fucking computer. I’ve begun staying up all night and going to work sleep deprived. There’s been a couple times i’ve attempted to call in sick so i could sleep in but they would still force me to come in or i risk being fired. I’ve been starting to hallucinate when i stay up past 2 days. Some days i’ll drive home from work expecting to immediately crash but the CPU drags me in….. And i end up staying up another night. I’ve been questioning reality more and more. I go down deep rabbit holes and read/see things that have scarred me but i haven’t felt it’s cut or pain yet. I look in the mirror and see someone that’s not me. The body i’m in…. It’s not mine. Why do i even have a body? Sometimes i feel as if this body is fucking useless. And that fits in with what my life purpose, a worthless piece of human flesh meant to work then die and eventually be replaced. Y’know that's probably why i like the CPU, i don’t have to pay attention to my body, i can almost ignore it and just stare at the screen and soak in everything that's coming towards my eyes. Go down deep web rabbit holes, jack off, watch youtube videos, this is life. This is the lifestyle of someone who is worthless. Which i am. I jack off in this shitty apartment just to feel something. Then i fuck up my brain, sense of time & reality just cause. Why does it matter if i perceive reality “normally”? Reality fucking sucks. No wait, reality doesn’t suck? I’m afraid? They’re after meeee? I need to get some fucking help.

	[Log 6]]: So i’ve heard religion can help fix you and feel better. I can’t afford a therapist but i don’t wanna turn into a religious nut. But i’m turning into a freako nut anyway so i guess it doesn’t really matter. I think i’ll just combine religions and make my own. Like a kind of buddhist christianity, where i pray to the “god” inside me (meditate) and give myself faith. I don’t think there is a god and if there was, why would i put my faith in a being that has allowed my life to be this way. I’ll put more faith in myself to become a better citizen to society and make my company more profit. It’s a win-win situation! I think this might be what will turn my life around. It’s almost like a confident boost. Self help cleaning my room type shit. I’ll just disregard the bad parts of me and focus on coming back to normalcy. I have to get myself back together quickly before i ruin what i have and get fired. I don’t want to be homeless.

<pre2><center>[ ]]</center>	I’ve observed a purpose can be assigned to a person by themself, by varying degrees of willingness and unwillingness. However the most meaningful purpose comes from a person's deepest desires. At its simplest form one seeks pleasure and one avoids pain. What minimizes pain and maximizes pleasure quite like power? It can be postulated that a person's primary purpose may easily be that toward power. But how is power achieved in the real world? It seems so simply defined that those in power remain in power and those of us below them must simply live without. Perhaps power, and by extension purpose, can only truly be found in a new realm where one wasn’t already assigned purposelessness.</pre2>

	[Log 7]]: I can’t go back to “normal.” i'm fucked beyond belief. I can’t reverse what's happened to me. I really thought I could bring myself back to “normal.” I’m such an idiot, i’m fucking stupid. I don’t deserve to live honestly.  My brain has already been opened up. I can’t pry it back shut. How can I even act that everything is fine when deep down it is not? It’s as if i'm a ticking time bomb waiting to explode, well more like implode. I don’t even have the courage to stop living on my own terms. I’ll just let this sedentary life take my energy and fucking suck me dry till I’m skin and bones with no soul.

	[Log 8]]: I'm 21 today. I'm just lying in my bed staring at the ceiling. I feel like a living corpse. Waiting till death comes to take me. Turned on no lights, didn’t eat or drink, no work. Just stared at the cold, grey ceiling.

	[Log 9]]: I’ve begun to use my vr headset and have started to use it more and more. In all of my life, i've never experienced something like this. When i put it on, it is as if i am in a different world entirely, and a better world at that. Some days i’ll sleep with my headset on so i can have some type of escape from this shitty, four walled, apartment. I feel that sometimes i’m almost living two different lives. The one being a worthless worker & human, and the one where i’m wired to screens that can take me to a better world for a brief time.

<pre2><center>[ ]]</center>	There seems to be a phenomena in the human mind in which, while capable of experiencing other reality, there is (generally unconsciously) a “main reality” or some sort of reality given priority to another. This reality, in the majority of cases, is the one we are born with and whatever altered versions follow it one step at a time from our interaction with the material world. Which realities we considered “artificial”, or in the case of technology “virtual”, is whatever reality we can form within the bounds of our own present reality.
	However, one may become adjusted to an “artificial” reality and it will become their prioritized realm. In this case the way one views artificial reality from their original, biological reality is inverted and from artificial reality is biological reality viewed as artificial. Once one’s life becomes consumed by the “false reality” in question it will become progressively more difficult for them to process their biological reality ever again. However, the artificial reality only exists within the biological reality, and by that a person develops an assumed detachment until they can create a reality in which biological reality only exists within the bounds of their artificial one.</pre2>

	[Log 10]]: i stopped showing up to work. Nobody has knocked on my door, called me, or came to check up on me. Nobody cares. They used me all up and now i’m left to die i guess. At least i have my computer and VR. That’s all i have and that’s all i’m in until my body goes in pains from not eating or using the bathroom. I surf the web now in the headset because i don’t want to see any hint of this shitty reality, even in my peripheral vision. There are times when in the headset where i'm reminded that my whole existence is worthless and i keep steeping lower and lower to the ultimate bottom that is black. Then i get out of that thinking by overloading my brain with info or just jacking off to porn. Which causes the cycle to start all over again.  My mind feels like mush and everything i see in my apartment doesn't even look real. I never go outside anymore and i've almost convinced myself that the whole world is just my apartment. In a way, it is. It’s all i ever see. And if this is all i see in this reality, of course i’d rather spend more of my time in the virtual reality. My concept of time has deteriorated, there are no windows in my apartment so i never know how long it’s been since i was fired and i never know if it is day or night. I wish there was a way to fully leave this actual reality and just live in the lines of the web & virtual reality. I’m starting to see my apartment as the fake reality.

	[Log 11]]: Goodbye world. I’ve decided to delve deep into the digital land and never come back. There’s nothing left for me here. I’ve failed myself in this reality. If i stay here another second i’ll... do it. I want to feel the digitization. I don’t want to feel my real body anymore. I don’t want to see this world anymore. I want all my senses cut off from this world. I want to disappear. I just want to disappear. I… just… want to…. Disappear. I wish i could cry one more time but the emotion won’t surface anymore. None of my emotions can surface anymore. I’m Empty. Goodbye to my irl self… i’ve failed you. I’ve failed everyone. At least there's a chance now for a second life.

<pre2><center>[ ]]</center>	If I were to consider death(human), the end of life(human), as the cessation of a continued experience then immortality, unending life, is achieved when the continued experience(C.E.) doesn’t go through a process of cessation(PoC, differentiated from just “cessation” by referring particularly to the process that actualizes cessation.) The PoC causes cessation and thus immortality is failed so I seek to find a solution to what obstructs the process. The PoC, put simply, is dying isolated apart from death.
	A single life, continued experience, does not exist in an isolated instance or location. While symbolically we consider our life to take part in our mind it is our reality, and by extension our atomic structure, which shapes “life”. If we were able to perfectly copy our atomic structure of self into a digital realm with some sort of actual atom or atom substitute of similar function we could continue life in the digital realm. One may argue this will just construct a copy of oneself however our “life” is not within a single location or instance as I’ve already mentioned and our current life will therefore be continued as it is the same life within another instance (think of it as another dimension). However this does not mean our life will be the same, obviously it will be dramatically different and we will be within a system we were not “made” to live within and it will be new grounds to us completely. If the simulation we live within is severed so are we and if whatever connects our simulated lives is severed we will be cut from each other.
	However immortality is, in fact, not the dominant force inspiring me to write this. A digital life can, theoretically, allow endless freedom to a person (including that of creating more life).
